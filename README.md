### About

I have been working within the IT industry for two decades, from System Administration and Network Infrastructure design to Cloud Architecture and DevOps Expert.

To date, I have been working in many successful companies helping them to innovate with state-of-art designs based on the AWS Well-Architecture framework. Those designs allow implementing a rock-solid and automated integration and delivery solution that leverages an auto-scalable and self-healing container ecosystem.

With DevOps philosophy in my soul, my daily routine starts with a "How can I make it simple, faster, and reliable?". Well, a code could always be better, so Python or NodeJS came into action to improve our logic.

Then, I think, "How can I make these integrations and deployment simple, faster, and reliable?" and here is when our Pipelines make it simple, Docker faster, and Kubernetes reliable.
